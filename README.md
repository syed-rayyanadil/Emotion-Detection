# FACIAL EMOTION RECOGNITION

Facial expressions are one of the most important ways people express their 
feelings. Humans can communicate their feelings and intentions through 
facial expression recognition, which is a strong, natural, and immediate 
method. Humans may be unable to express their feelings in certain 
situations, such as when they are hospitalized or have certain disabilities; as 
a result, improved recognition of other human emotions can lead to more 
effective communication.

In today's world, facial emotion recognition is a critical problem in a variety 
of applications. Facial emotion recognition has been the subject of much 
study in recent years. The goal of facial emotion recognition is to use specific 
facial images to help determine the state of human emotion (e.g., neutral, 
happy, sad, surprise, anxiety, rage, disgust, contempt). Face emotion 
recognition is a difficult task because it requires high accuracy in recognizing
facial emotion states. As a result, determining whether two people have the 
same emotion state is difficult because they may express the same emotion 
state in different ways. For instance, depending on the individual's mood, 
skin color, age, and surrounding environment, the expression may vary.
